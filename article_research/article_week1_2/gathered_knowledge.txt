[RESEARCH] habitat fragmentation landscape ecology research


Habitat fragmentation research shows that breaking up continuous habitats into smaller patches has multiple effects on biodiversity. Recent studies indicate that edge effects can penetrate 100-300 meters into forest fragments. Small fragments lose species through demographic stochasticity and reduced habitat quality. Connectivity between fragments is crucial for maintaining metapopulations.

[RESEARCH] edge effects landscape ecology research


Disturbance regimes are changing globally due to climate change and human activities. Fire suppression has altered natural fire cycles in many ecosystems. Large-scale disturbances create complex spatial patterns that influence succession and species composition. Understanding disturbance history is crucial for restoration planning.

[RESEARCH] edge effects forest, urban examples


Scale-dependent relationships are fundamental to landscape ecology. Patterns observed at fine scales may not predict landscape-level processes. The modifiable areal unit problem affects how we interpret spatial data. Multi-scale approaches are necessary to understand ecological processes across hierarchical levels.
