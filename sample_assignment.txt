Assignment: Landscape Fragmentation and Conservation Planning
Course: GEOG/EVST 5015C - Landscape Ecology
Word Count: 600-800 words total

Learning Objectives:
- Understand the ecological impacts of habitat fragmentation
- Analyze the relationship between landscape structure and biodiversity
- Evaluate conservation strategies for fragmented landscapes
- Synthesize landscape ecology concepts with planning applications

Instructions:
Work with the AI tutor to develop thoughtful responses to each question. Use specific evidence from the assigned article and demonstrate critical thinking that goes beyond simple description.

Questions:

1. Define and contrast fragmentation versus connectivity
Using specific examples from the article, explain how fragmentation and connectivity differ as landscape ecology concepts. What are the key mechanisms by which each affects ecological processes? Support your definitions with evidence from the text, including page references where possible.

2. Analyze the relationship between patch size and species diversity
The authors present data on how patch size influences species diversity in fragmented landscapes. What specific patterns did the researchers find? How convincing is their evidence? Examine both the strengths and potential limitations of their methodology. What alternative explanations might exist for the patterns they observed?

3. Evaluate conservation strategies for fragmented landscapes  
The article discusses several approaches to conservation in fragmented environments (corridors, buffer zones, habitat restoration, etc.). Compare and contrast at least two of these strategies. Which approach do you think would be most effective in your local area, and why? Consider both ecological effectiveness and practical implementation challenges.

4. Synthesize landscape ecology principles with planning applications
How does this study connect to broader landscape ecology concepts we've discussed in class? Identify at least two other concepts from our course materials and explain how they relate to the findings presented. What implications do these connections have for landscape planning and management?

Assessment Criteria:
- Use specific evidence and citations from the article
- Demonstrate analytical thinking beyond description  
- Make clear connections between concepts
- Show understanding of both ecological processes and practical applications
- Write clearly and organize responses logically

Note: Each response should be approximately 150-200 words. Focus on quality of analysis rather than length.
